Hello! My name is Sophia, and this is my portfolio. You can check it out at jysophia.github.io/portfolio

A brief overview of me: I'm a student pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science degree at the University of British Columbia. My background is in public
health - my previous degrees from the University of Toronto (Bachelor of Arts, Health Studies and Sociology) and Western University (Master of
Public Health).

I am actively looking for a 4 or 8-month co-op position starting Fall 2022. I love to learn and get my hands on any opportunity to challenge
myself. If you'd like to discuss my experiences, please e-mail me at jysophiakim@gmail.com

Have a lovely day!
