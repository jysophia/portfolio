								<p>Hello! I'm Sophia, and I enjoy creating things in the digital space! I have a previous life in public health and recently graduated from the Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) program at UBC. As someone with blended experiences, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to make our physical and digital world a better place. I'm constantly striving to hone my skills and build solutions for real needs. I'd be excited to offer my expertise wherever they may fit!</p>
								<p>The technologies that I've been using are Java, Python, Kotlin, XML, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and more. Some of my proudest projects come from hackathons and school projects. You can check them out under <a href="#projects">my projects.</a> I have more exciting things in the works, so please stay tuned!</p>
								<!-- <p>I also offer private lessons and tutoring! I teach programming in Java and provide tutoring for programming classes for grades 6-12. If you'd like more information, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> and I'd be excited to chat.</p> -->
								<p>If you are interested in what I did prior to Computer Science, you can check out <a href="#research">my research.</a></p>

											<p>Java Runtime Analyzer | Course Work (CPSC 410 @ UBC):</p>
											<p>This is a Runtime Analyzer for Java Code, developed as an educational tool for new developers. I worked in a group of five and was responsible for building the frontend, where users can upload multiple JSON files of their telemetry code (generated manually). I leveraged React.js and MaterialUI to build out the components and ensure a seamless workflow and intuitive user experience. The Runtime Analyzer features an interactive visual representation of the code that shows how the runtime changes with different inputs. The motivation for this project was to provide a tool for new developers that would help them have a better understanding of their code and work towards a more deterministic codebase.</p>

											<p>Music Sheet DSL | Course Work (CPSC 410 @ UBC):</p>
											<p>This is a Music Sheet DSL where users can use their musical creativity to efficiently create sheet music. I worked in a group of five, and led the design of the grammar rules, conducting the user study, and implementing any feedback received. I leveraged ANTLR to create the grammar rules, JUnit to text the lexer and parser, and Java to convert tokens to AST objects. This DSL features the ability to create notes, chords, and sequences, mutate the key and beat of the notes to the user's liking, and repeat a series of notes and chords while simultaneously mutating them inside a sequence.</p>

											<p>seek refuge | cmd-f 2022:</p>
											<p>This is a Chrome extension that centralizes all the resources needed for the refugee-seeking process in Canada. I researched and consolidated the necessary documents and resources onto the Firestore database, and used React to handle user queries and retrieve asynchronous data. This hackathon took place just as the Russian-Ukrainian War broke out, so it was a passion project for the team. We came in 2nd Place (Silver Prize) in the competition and 2nd Place in the TELUS: Leverage technology to support social sustainability and community building sponsorship.</p>

											<p>hearo | StormHacks 2022:</p>
											<p>This is a speech-to-text app designed to help people with hearing aid failures, healthcare workers engage with patients, and older adults who need assistance with communication. I implemented the WebSocket API using React hooks to set up our speech-to-text feature and assisted in the integration of Twilio and AssemlyAI API. The idea was inspired by our personal and professional experiences, coming from health backgrounds and observing what people need in a fast-paced society like ours. We came in Top 5 in the competition and received the Most Creative Use of Twilio Award. This was a huge accomplishment as it was only my second hackathon and I was working alongside other beginner hackers.</p>

											<p>Dog or Dawg Therapy | nwHacks 2022:</p>
											<p>This is an online chat bot created to meet emotional and entertainment needs during social isolation. This hackathon took place at a time when the Omicron variant broke out and all activities were transitioned back online. The team wanted to present something fun but therapeutic to people who may be bored or lonely during that time of social distancing. This was my first hackathon and my very first time using Javascript and React. I created the GUI for the chat feature using MaterialUI and Javascript.</p>

								<p>This is an unconventional research project presented in the form of a documentary film. During my undergraduate career at the University of Toronto, I wanted to investigate the aging experience in Ontario's healthcare system. I interviewed an older adult, a family caregiver, and a social worker - then showed their footages to a healthcare leader of their choice, who responded to their interviews. I led the entire project from creating the protocol and research documents to managing post-production.</p>
